# Epic 8 — Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Implementation

**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks  
**Architecture Reference**: [`docs/architecture/bff-architecture.md`](../architecture/bff-architecture.md)

## Epic Goal

Implement a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) layer to reduce frontend complexity, improve API performance, and enhance maintainability while preserving all existing functionality and ensuring seamless integration with the current Hewston trading platform.

## Why (Value)

- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce frontend complexity by centralizing API logic and data transformations
- **Performance Optimization**: Aggregate multiple API calls into single requests, implement intelligent caching
- **System Maintainability**: Consolidate scattered API patterns into cohesive, well-documented layer
- **User Experience**: Faster chart loading times and more reliable WebSocket connections
- **Risk Mitigation**: Gradual migration approach with feature flags for instant rollback capability

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current Functionality:** FastAPI backend serving React frontend with direct API calls for chart data, run details, and WebSocket streaming
- **Technology Stack:** FastAPI + Python 3.11, React + TypeScript, SQLite catalog, Parquet data files, WebSocket real-time streaming
- **Integration Points:** Frontend API client (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`), Backend endpoints (`/backtests`, `/bars/*`), WebSocket streaming (`/backtests/{id}/ws`)
- **Architecture Pattern:** Hexagonal architecture with ports/adapters, presentational-only React components

### Enhancement Details

- **What's Being Added:** New BFF service (`bff/` directory) providing aggregated APIs, WebSocket proxy, and data transformation layer
- **How It Integrates:** BFF sits between existing frontend and backend, proxying and enhancing communication without modifying either system
- **Technology Choice:** FastAPI + Python for consistency with existing backend stack and team expertise

### Success Criteria

- **Complexity Reduction:** 50% reduction in frontend API complexity through aggregated endpoints
- **Performance Maintenance:** Maintained ~30 FPS WebSocket streaming performance with <100ms additional API latency
- **Zero Breaking Changes:** All existing functionality preserved during gradual migration
- **Migration Safety:** Feature flags enable instant rollback to direct backend calls

## Scope

### In Scope

- **BFF Service Infrastructure:** FastAPI service with health endpoints, logging, error handling
- **HTTP Proxy Layer:** Pass-through proxy for existing backend endpoints with enhanced logging
- **Data Aggregation:** Unified chart data endpoint combining multiple bar timeframes
- **Run Data Optimization:** Single endpoint combining run details, metrics, and equity data
- **WebSocket Proxy:** Enhanced WebSocket management with connection pooling and reconnection
- **Frontend Integration:** API client updates with feature flags for gradual migration
- **Caching Layer:** Optional Redis caching for performance optimization
- **Monitoring Integration:** Comprehensive logging and metrics following existing patterns

### Out of Scope

- **Backend Modifications:** No changes to existing FastAPI backend service
- **Database Schema Changes:** BFF operates read-only on existing SQLite catalog
- **UI/UX Changes:** No modifications to existing React components or user interfaces
- **Authentication Changes:** Pass-through existing authentication, no new auth logic
- **New Trading Features:** Focus purely on architectural enhancement, not business functionality

## Stories

#### Story 8.2: Basic HTTP Proxy Implementation
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: Story 8.1

**User Story**: As a frontend developer, I want BFF endpoints that proxy existing backend APIs with proper logging and error handling, so that I can gradually migrate API calls without changing functionality.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Proxy endpoints for `/backtests`, `/bars/*` endpoints
- Authentication pass-through to backend
- Error handling maintaining existing response formats
- Request/response logging with correlation IDs

### Phase 2: Data Transformation (Week 2-3)

#### Story 8.3: Chart Data Aggregation Endpoint
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: Story 8.2

**User Story**: As a trader, I want charts to load faster with consistent data formats, so that I can analyze market data efficiently without multiple loading states.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Unified `/api/v1/chart-data` endpoint for all timeframes
- Data transformation and decimation logic moved from frontend
- Response caching with Redis integration
- Performance optimization for large datasets

#### Story 8.4: Run Data Aggregation Endpoint
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: Story 8.2

**User Story**: As a trader, I want complete backtest information in a single request, so that I can quickly review run performance without multiple loading states.

**Key Deliverables**:
- `/api/v1/runs/{id}/complete` endpoint combining multiple backend calls
- Aggregated response with run details, metrics, and equity data
- Intelligent caching for frequently accessed runs
- Error handling for partial data failures

### Phase 3: WebSocket Enhancement (Week 3-4)

#### Story 8.5: WebSocket Proxy and Connection Management
**Effort**: 4-5 days
