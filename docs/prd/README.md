# Hewston PRD — Epics Folder

Canonical PRD is maintained in a single file: docs/prd.md.

This folder is now used only for epic files and their stories/acceptance criteria:
- 06 Epics — docs/prd/06-epics/

Notes:
- Non-epic shards (00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 90, 99) are deprecated and may stop receiving updates.
- When adding a new feature: update docs/prd.md (FR/NFR and Epic List) and add a new epic file under docs/prd/06-epics/.
