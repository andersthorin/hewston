## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential Dependencies
```
Story 8.1 (Foundation)
    ↓
Story 8.2 (Proxy) ← Required for all subsequent stories
    ↓
Stories 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 (Can be developed in parallel)
    ↓
Story 8.6 (Frontend Migration)
```

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Stories 8.3 & 8.4**: Can be developed simultaneously after Story 8.2
- **Story 8.5**: Can be developed in parallel with 8.3/8.4
- **Testing**: Can be developed alongside implementation stories

### Risk Mitigation Through Phasing
- **Phase 1**: Establishes foundation with minimal risk
- **Phase 2**: Adds value while maintaining existing functionality
- **Phase 3**: Enhances reliability without breaking changes
- **Phase 4**: Completes migration with full rollback capability

## Success Metrics by Phase

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- ✅ BFF service runs alongside existing services without interference
- ✅ Health monitoring and logging integrated with existing infrastructure
- ✅ Development workflow unchanged for existing services

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- ✅ Chart data loads 50% faster through aggregated endpoint
- ✅ Run analysis requires single API call instead of 3+ calls
- ✅ Caching reduces repeated data requests by 80%+

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- ✅ WebSocket streaming maintains ~30 FPS performance
- ✅ Automatic reconnection eliminates manual connection management
- ✅ Connection reliability improves by 90%+

### Phase 4 Success Criteria
- ✅ Frontend complexity reduced by 50%+ for data-heavy components
- ✅ Feature flags enable instant rollback capability
- ✅ No regression in user experience or performance

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Approach by Phase
- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure and integration testing
- **Phase 2**: Data transformation and performance testing
- **Phase 3**: Connection reliability and load testing
- **Phase 4**: End-to-end and regression testing

### Continuous Validation
- Performance monitoring throughout implementation
- Regression testing after each story completion
- User experience validation at phase boundaries
- Feature flag testing for rollback scenarios
