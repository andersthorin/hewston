# Story 6.0 — UX artifacts: wireframes and FE component map
Story ID: S6.0
Epic ID: E6

Status: Draft

User Story
- As a frontend developer,
- I want clear wireframes, flows, and a component map with prop contracts,
- So that I can implement the Playback UI without churn or ambiguity.

Context
- This story produces UX deliverables prior to FE implementation (6.1–6.3).

Dependencies
- Depends on: PRD + Architecture baselines

Definition of Ready
- Baselines, WS protocol, and FE boundaries reviewed
- Wireframe scope agreed (screens + states)
- Component map structure agreed (presentational vs containers/hooks)

- Blocks: S6.1, S6.2, S6.3

References
- Frontend boundaries: docs/architecture/source-tree.md
- Presentational-only rule: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
- WS protocol: docs/api/ws-protocol.md

Acceptance Criteria
1) Wireframes for Runs List and Run Detail delivered under docs/ui/wireframes/ (include normal, loading, error, and empty states; controls for play/pause/seek/speed; overlays for orders/fills; equity chart)
2) User flows documented (open run from list → playback detail → rerun from manifest)
3) Component map with prop contracts under docs/frontend/component-map.md, including:
   - Presentational components (no fetch/mutate) with explicit props
   - Containers/hooks/services boundaries and responsibilities
   - WS hook + Worker interfaces (events/handlers)
4) Accessibility notes captured (keyboard nav expectations, contrast guidance)
5) Cross-links added to README “Docs Map” or Architecture as appropriate

Tasks / Subtasks
- Produce wireframes in preferred format (images/Markdown/links) under docs/ui/wireframes/
- Write component map and props contracts (Markdown)
- Validate against WS protocol and baselines; ensure presentational-only constraints

Definition of Done
- Artifacts exist at referenced paths; content sufficient for FE to implement 6.1–6.3 without additional elicitation.
