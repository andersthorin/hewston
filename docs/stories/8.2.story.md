# Story 8.2: Basic HTTP Proxy Implementation

**Epic**: Epic 8 â€” Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Implementation
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: Story 8.1 (BFF Service Infrastructure Setup)
**Status**: Ready for Development

## User Story

As a **frontend developer**,  
I want **BFF endpoints that proxy existing backend APIs with proper logging and error handling**,  
So that **I can gradually migrate frontend API calls to the BFF layer without changing functionality**.

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration

- **Integrates with**: Existing FastAPI backend endpoints (`/backtests`, `/bars/*`)
- **Technology**: FastAPI async patterns, httpx client, existing error handling
- **Follows pattern**: Existing backend API structure and error response formats
- **Touch points**: Frontend API client, backend endpoints, error handling middleware

### Business Context

This story creates the foundation for frontend migration by establishing transparent proxy functionality. The proxy must maintain exact API compatibility to enable gradual migration without breaking existing frontend functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Core Endpoint Proxying**
   - BFF proxies key backend endpoints: `/backtests`, `/backtests/{id}`, `/bars/daily`, `/bars/minute`, `/bars/hour`
   - All HTTP methods (GET, POST) are properly proxied with complete request/response bodies
   - Query parameters and path parameters are forwarded correctly to backend
   - Response headers and status codes are preserved from backend

2. **Authentication Pass-through**
   - Authentication tokens (Authorization header) are passed through transparently to backend
   - No authentication logic implemented in BFF layer
   - Backend authentication responses (401, 403) are forwarded unchanged
   - Session management remains handled by existing backend

3. **Error Response Compatibility**
   - Error responses maintain existing format and status codes from backend
   - BFF-specific errors (backend unavailable) use consistent error format
   - Error correlation IDs link BFF and backend errors for debugging
   - Timeout handling provides appropriate error responses

4. **Request/Response Logging**
   - All proxy requests logged with correlation IDs, timing, and status codes
   - Request/response bodies logged at debug level for troubleshooting
   - Backend communication errors logged with appropriate severity
   - Performance metrics captured for proxy latency analysis

### Integration Requirements

5. **Backend Compatibility**
   - Existing backend endpoints continue to work unchanged when called directly
   - No modifications required to existing backend service
   - Backend error handling and response formats preserved exactly
   - Existing API contracts maintained without changes

6. **FastAPI Pattern Consistency**
   - New BFF proxy endpoints follow existing FastAPI async patterns
   - Dependency injection follows existing backend patterns
   - Middleware integration maintains current error handling behavior
   - Route organization follows existing backend API structure

7. **Frontend Compatibility**
   - BFF proxy endpoints return identical responses to direct backend calls
   - Frontend API client can switch between direct backend and BFF without changes
   - Existing frontend error handling continues to work unchanged
   - Response timing and behavior match existing backend patterns

### Quality Requirements

8. **Testing Coverage**
   - Proxy functionality covered by integration tests with mock backend
   - Authentication pass-through tested with valid and invalid tokens
   - Error handling tested for various backend failure scenarios
   - Performance baseline established for proxy latency

9. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Request/response logging includes correlation IDs and timing information
   - Metrics collection for proxy success/failure rates
   - Backend communication health monitoring
   - Error rate tracking and alerting thresholds

10. **Regression Prevention**
    - No regression in existing API functionality verified through test suite
    - Existing frontend functionality continues to work unchanged
    - Backend service performance not impacted by BFF proxy layer

## Technical Notes

### Integration Approach
- Use httpx async client to proxy requests to existing backend service
- Implement transparent proxy pattern preserving all request/response details
- Add correlation ID tracking for request tracing across services

### Existing Pattern Reference
- Follow existing backend error handling patterns from `backend/api/middleware/`
- Use existing FastAPI dependency injection patterns
- Mirror existing backend route organization in `backend/api/`

### Key Constraints
- Must preserve exact API contracts without modifications
- Maintain authentication flow without implementing auth logic
- No backend modifications allowed
- Performance impact must be minimal (<50ms additional latency)

### Proxy Implementation Pattern
```python
# Example proxy endpoint structure
@router.get("/backtests")
async def proxy_list_backtests(
    request: Request,
    backend_client: BackendClient = Depends(get_backend_client)
):
    # Forward request to backend with all headers/params
    response = await backend_client.proxy_request(
        method="GET",
        path="/backtests",
        headers=request.headers,
        params=request.query_params
    )
    return response
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Preserve backend error responses exactly
- Add BFF-specific error context for infrastructure failures
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for backend unavailability
- Maintain error correlation across service boundaries

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Proxy Functionality**: BFF proxy endpoints successfully forward requests to backend
- [ ] **Authentication**: Authentication tokens pass through correctly to backend
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Error responses maintain existing response formats and status codes
- [ ] **Logging**: Request/response logging includes proper correlation tracking and timing
- [ ] **Testing**: Integration tests verify proxy functionality with mock and real backend
- [ ] **Performance**: Proxy latency baseline established and within acceptable limits
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Existing API functionality continues to work unchanged
- [ ] **Documentation**: Proxy endpoint documentation and troubleshooting guide created

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risk
**API Contract Changes**: Proxy implementation inadvertently modifies API contracts

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive integration testing with existing frontend
- Exact response format validation
- Contract testing between BFF and backend

### Secondary Risk
**Performance Degradation**: Additional network hop impacts response times

### Mitigation
- Performance baseline measurement
- Async implementation for optimal throughput
- Monitoring and alerting for latency thresholds

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flags to disable BFF proxy endpoints
- Frontend can continue using direct backend calls
- Remove proxy routes from BFF service

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Proxy request forwarding logic
- Error handling for various backend responses
- Authentication header pass-through

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end proxy functionality with mock backend
- Authentication flow testing
- Error scenario testing (backend down, timeout, etc.)

### Contract Tests
- Response format validation against existing API contracts
- Error response format consistency
- Authentication behavior verification

### Performance Tests
- Proxy latency measurement
- Concurrent request handling
- Backend communication reliability
