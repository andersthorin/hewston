epic: E7
title: Logging and minimal metrics (operability)
decision: PASS
rationale: JSON logs (http.access), minimal counters for WS/SSE, and structlog integration verified; no regressions in tests.

  - code: backend/app/main.py middleware; backend/api/routes/backtests.py logs
  - ops: logs include request_id/run_id where applicable
