story: S6.3
epic: E6
title: WS hook, Worker parsing, and overlays wiring
decision: PASS
rationale: WS hook and worker parsing implemented; playback container integrates; build succeeds.
evidence:
  - build: frontend npm run build (Node 22)
  - code: src/services/ws.ts, src/workers/streamParser.ts, containers/RunPlayerContainer
notes:
  - add FE tests for worker/hook lifecycle and backpressure behavior
